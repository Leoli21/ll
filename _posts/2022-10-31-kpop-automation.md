## Description
This project is a command-line tool that I built to extract real-time top music chart data from multiple websites. It uses BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping and Selenium WebDriver for dynamic content extraction. Additionally, I leveraged the Spotify Web API to seamlessly query songs, add them to playlists, and automate the creation of playlists directly in a user's Spotify account.

You can check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/Leoli21/KPopAutomation" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

## Technologies Used:
Python, BeautifulSoup4, Selenium WebDriver, Spotipy
