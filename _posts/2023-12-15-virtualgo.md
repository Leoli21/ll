## Description
As part of a team of four, I contributed to the development of a full-stack stock portfolio management system using Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL. The system integrates the Alpaca API to provide real-time market data, multi-portfolio management, and algorithmic trading capabilities. My contributions focused on optimizing stock transaction processing and implementing user session management to enhance the user experience.
