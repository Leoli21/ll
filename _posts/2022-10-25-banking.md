## Description
In this project, I designed and implemented a banking transaction system using test-driven development (TDD) to ensure high-quality, reliable code. I wrote over 300 unit tests with JUnit, achieving 90% code coverage. The automated testing was integrated into a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, enabling continuous integration and efficient testing throughout the development process.
