## Description
LobsterAI is a research project looking at how to create a first draft manuscript from a drug trial protocol. This involves taking a protocol, which is an internal document of dense text and figures detailing how an experiment was performed, and condensing it into a manuscript ready to be published in a medical journal. A first draft can take 20-30 hours of human work, and often involves formulaic and repetitive steps. Our research focuses on using AWS tools to create a solution to produce an accurate partial or total rough draft of a manuscript for a given protocol. Because these documents are proprietary and internal, security is also a key factor.
